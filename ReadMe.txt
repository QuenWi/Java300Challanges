In the package Helpers, are some scripts used for the test-files.
The scripts in there are not used for the tasks, with only a few exceptions.

All the methodes which are makes sense to create as a
generic methode, I implemented as such.
Furthermore, most of the methods can be copy and pasted by themself into other projects.

Furthermore the following Methodes follow the following:

-[9 Summary Ranges, 10 Missing Ranges, 11 Merge Intervals, 12 Insert Intervals]:
    They all use the selfmade Class "Intervals". I created this class myself to
    do this tasks. You can find this class under "Helpers/Interval.java".
    Furthermore, I implemented a Comperator for it.
-[23 Shortest Word Distance I, 25 Shortest Word Distance III]:
    Due to its similarity I just implemented both in one Methode. "Shortest Word Distance".
-[24 Shortest Word Distance II]
    I didn't implemented it.
-[26 Intersection of two Arrays, 27 Intersection of two Arrays II]
    I think there is a mistake in the file. This two tasks are the same.
-[28 Two Sum II Input array is sorted, 29 Two Sum III Data structure design, 30 3Sum, 31 4Sum]
    I implemented them all in one. The method is XSum. You can there find the sum
    of any amount of elements.
-[32 3Sum Closest]
    It is implemented in the method XSum_Shortest. You can additional do it with every amount of elements.
-[35 Longest Common Prefix]
    I don't understand the problem. Therefor I didn't solved it yet.
-[38 Median of two sorted Arrays]
    It is wrong. I've to do it another time again.
-[39 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II, 40 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II]
    They are put together in one method.
-[41 Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted_Array]
    It uses the Interval class. (See first note)
-[44 Search in Rotated Sorted Array, 45 Search in Rotated Sorted Array II]
    It uses the Interval class. Furthermore, they are put together in one method.
-[49 HIndex, 50 HIndex II]
    They are put together in one method.
-[56 Two Sum]
    Implemented in XSum Method.
-[63 Substring with Concatenation of All Words]
    I implemented it wrong. I'll repeat it later.
-[69 Majority Element II]
    I skipped this task.
[75 Meeting Rooms II, 76 Meeting Rooms]
    It uses the Interval class. (See first note)
[77 Range Addition]
    I don't understand the task.
[103 Rotate Array in Java]
    This task exists two times in the document.
[109 Queue Reconstruction by Height]
    I don't understand this task.
[113 Design Snake Game]
    It would not fit good in here.
